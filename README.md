# Work of "Web-technologies and Web-design" subject
I created the website with server step by step for the 1st semester of 2nd course of the "Web-technologies and Web-design" subject. The work is divided into 11 tasks, in which students will post the functionality of the website in accordance with the material.

## How to run your Node.JS server🧐
#### 1. Download project files
- At first download the source code of this project.
#### 2. Download installation source files 
- Binaries, installers, and source tarballs are available at <https://nodejs.org>. ```(you need LTS Release)```
#### 3. Use Command Prompt to run server
- Check the version of Node.js with the command:
```
node -v
```
- Run following commands👇
```
npm install
npm start
```
> **npm** is the package manager for JavaScript
#### 4. Make sure that all is working with your MongoDB and you able to send data with REST🌈
- send ```get/post``` request to ```localhost:<your port>/api/bears```
- get post data ( by field ```longdescription```,```shortdescription```,```title```)

_Finally, all is work!_ 👨🏻‍💻
